# Assets

This directory should contain the following image files:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024 recommended)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (foreground)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon

Currently, these are placeholder files. You should replace them with your actual app icons and splash screens before building for production.
